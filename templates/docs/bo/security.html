            zbAction validates the legitimacy of an action in many ways. One of these ways is through your board's current URL. If the URL shown in the account manager does not match your board's current URL be sure to change it as no modifications will work until you do so.

            Note: Due to security concerns, we do not allow users to freely change their default board URL. Please create a topic on the <a href="{{ url_for('support') }}">support forum</a> if you need to change your default board URL.

        <p>
            In order to keep your zbAction installation as secure as possible. We recommend that you follow the following guidelines:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Never share your zbAction password with anybody.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only add modifications you trust.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep all zbAction modification code directly below the zbAction code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don't touch the zbAction code unless you know what you are doing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you feel an added modification is not safe, remove it from your zbAction account <b>first</b>. After that, remove it from your board template. Removing a modification from your account results in an immediate change. Removing a modification from your board template does not&mdash;a page reload is required in order for the change to take effect.
                </li>
            </ul>
