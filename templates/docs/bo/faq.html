        <p>
            During the installation process, zbAction will typically use one Ad Removal credit for every 40-50 members on your board. Once installed, zbAction does not use any Ad Removal credits. If your Ad Removal credits are being quickly consumed, it's a good idea to see what modifications you have installed to track down the culprit.
