            Creating a zbAction modification is straightforward and easy. In this quickstart guide, we'll be diving head first into the basics of developing for zbAction and creating a minimalistic poke modification similar to Facebook's poke feature. Before we can do anything, however, we need to hook into into zbAction. We can do that by calling <span class="literal">zbAction.ready</span>.
        </p>
        {{ code.literal('zbAction.ready(api_key, function);', lang='javascript') }}
        <p>
            <span class="literal">zbAction.ready</span> takes two arguments: an API key and an execution function. When zbAction is done loading, execution functions are called and passed an instance of <span class="literal">zbAction</span>. Let's say we have some code like this:
        </p>
        {{ code.source('example/docs/quickstart_hello_world.js') }}
        <p>
            In the above example, when zbAction is finished loading, the execution function will automatically be called and an alert with the text "Hello World!" will appear.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Before we go any further, we should write the code to place a poke button on user profiles. Let's modify the previous example to do that.
        </p>
        {{ code.source('example/docs/quickstart_place_button.js') }}
        <hr />
        <p>
            Now that we have that done, we can start interfacing with zbAction. zbAction provides two standard methods for interfacing with it. These functions are: <span class="literal">zbAction.register</span> and <span class="literal">zbAction.send</span>. <span class="literal">zbAction.register</span> allows you to register action event handlers specific to your modification while <span class="literal">zbAction.send</span> allows you to send actions to be received by your modification.
        </p>
        {{ code.literal('zbAction.register(event_name, function(action_template));') }}
        {{ code.literal('zbAction.send(action_template);', lang='javascript') }}
        <p>
            Action events are handled similarly to standard DOM events. <span class="literal">zbAction.register</span> is roughly equivalent to <span class="literal">document.addEventListener</span> in terms of purpose and functionality while <span class="literal">zbAction.send</span> is roughly equivalent to <span class="literal">ele.dispatchEvent</span> where <span class="literal">ele</span> is some arbitrary HTML DOM element.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Below is an example usage of these two methods.
        </p>
        {{ code.source('example/docs/quickstart_send_register.js') }}
        <p>
            The code above will register an action event handler for the action "example" and then immediately send the action "example" to the user with uid <span class="literal">example_uid</span>. When the user with uid <span class="literal">example_uid</span> receives the action "example", an alert saying "Received an action through event 'example'" will appear. The user will also see a second alert with the action event's details.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actions are sent and received as action templates. Action templates are represented as objects and have three required properties: an event name, any event details, and information about the sender/receiver; everything else is optional. Therefore, the example above utilizes the most basic form of action template as it only sends the bare necessities.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            We now know how to send and receive actions which means we can finish our poke system modification. The first thing we'll want to do is register an action event handler so we can handle pokes from other users.
        </p>
        {{ code.source('example/docs/quickstart_register.js') }}
        <p>
            Remembering that action templates <b>must</b> contain information about either the source or the receiver, we can use the <span class="literal">name</span> property of <span class="literal">action.source</span> to get the name of the person who poked us. By registering an event handler on "zba-poke-example", our specified execution function will run every time the current user receives the action "zba-poke-example". This means whenever current user is poked, they will receive an alert saying "You have been poked by {{ '<insert username here>' }}".
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Let's finish up this modification by putting in the code to actually poke somebody.
        </p>
        {{ code.source('example/docs/quickstart_finish.js') }}
        <p>
            In this step, we register a click event handler on the profile menu item we inserted previously. We then pass to the event handler a function that calls <span class="literal">zbAction.send</span> where an action template with the event name "zba-poke-example" is passed. Our modification is now complete and fully functional.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            You should now be armed with a basic knowledge of zbAction. With this knowledge, should be able to create your own zbAction modifications.
