        <p>
            Because actions are meant to be one-time use, zbAction does not offer a way to keep track of actions besides the <span class="literal">seen</span> flag in <a href="{{ url_for('docs', category='dev', page='js-sdk', _anchor='object.action_template') }}">action templates</a>. Therefore, if your modification reuses actions, it is necessary for you to implement your own action tracking. One way for you to keep track of actions is to store them as strings inside a database. Even something simple such as a NoSQL database will get the job done.
        </p>
        <p>
            We understand that sometimes you will need to perform an action lookup to find a particular action from the past. To help with this, zbAction exposes a single REST API endpoint (the remainder of the API is still in the works). This endpoint will return all data associated with an action as JSON.
        </p>
        {{ code.literal(
'GET: ' + url_for('api.get_action_by_id', action_id='action_id') + '\n'
+ 'Response Type: application/json\n'
+ 'Cache Time: 60 minutes\n'
+ url_for('api.get_action_by_id', action_id='action_id', _external=True), lang='nohighlight') }}

        <p>
            Actions will sometimes be sent to a user who is not online. To ensure that a user receives all actions sent to him or her, zbAction stores any actions that are unable to be sent and batch sends them when a user comes online.
